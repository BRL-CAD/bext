For building OSL to work, it is necessary that the bundled clang (if a bundled
LLVM is in use) also work.  Clang on Linux needs gcc headers, and will look in
multiple locations.  If a location with an incomplete directory is found, that
will be problematic.

Observed example:

libgcc-14-dev directory was present on a system with gcc 13 as the compiler.
Clang reported it was selecting that directory rather than the 13-dev
directory, and subsequent builds were failing due to missing basic C++ headers.

Solution was to remove the libgcc-14-dev directory (in the case prompting this
note, it apparently got pulled in to support emacs packages)
