The BRL-CAD netpbm repository has a "brlcad" branch, where the (fairly
extensive) portability mods we make to the vanilla NETPBM upstream sources are
kept.  The submodule targets that branch, rather than main - main is used for
the vanilla upstream sources to allow us to get per-version diffs and more
easily merge upstream changes into the brlcad branch.
