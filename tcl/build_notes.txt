--Building tcl debug with symbols--
In order to build with symbols which allows tcl to be stepped through with a 
debugger, we need to update the nmake lines in the build and install steps to
include "DEBUG=1 symbols=all"

i.e. in tcl_build.cmake.in & tcl_install.cmake.in
"nmake -f makefile.vc install INSTALLDIR=@CMAKE_BUNDLE_INSTALL_PREFIX@ SUFX=\n" ->
"nmake -f makefile.vc DEBUG=1 symbols=all install INSTALLDIR=@CMAKE_BUNDLE_INSTALL_PREFIX@ SUFX=\n"

Note that this effect the build tree paths, which will likely break dependent
builds (like tk). A quick, hacky way to get around this is to build only 
TCL_BLD with the symbols on first, and then remove the edits to build 
the rest of bext 'normally'.
