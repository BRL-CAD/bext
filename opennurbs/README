openNURBS Toolkit consists of C++ source code for a library that will read and
write openNURBS 3D model files (.3dm) as well as a number of basic lower level
NURBS routines.

Note that some of these patches DO have behavior modification implications.


Debugging notes:  working on an issue where a Java load of the OpenNURBS.dll
file fails.  Starting with the knowledge that 7.38.2 works.

Doesn't appear to be related to the CMake build setup - 7.38.2 build
stand-alone in bext successfully, but minimal adjustment of that CMakeLists.txt
file to build the newer files results in a dll that still fails.

Started working through the changes to incrementally introduce them and see
when the failure is first observed.  Appears to be narrowing down to:

opennurbs_3dm_attributes.cpp
opennurbs_post_effects.cpp

The latter we might be able to just comment out, at least for now, but we
need the former.  Trying to isolate what about the changes is problematic -
a switch was made from default to explicit constructors, but it looks like
other changes are also present...

Note:  for debugging iteration, using the JavaCheck.cmake file in bext/CMake
to quickly look for problems:

cmake -DDLLSUFFIX=".dll" -DLL_DIR=C:\Users\me\opennurbs_working\build\Release -P C:\Users\bext\CMake\JavaCheck.cmake

Make sure to copy the z_brl.dll file from bext_output\install\bin to opennurbs_working\build\Release, since
it will be needed to successfully load OpenNURBS.dll
