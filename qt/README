Rather than attempting to build all of Qt's components, we deliberately focus
on a more minimal subset for easier compilation.

Sources are from:  https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/

Current version present:  6.6.2


Building on Redhat 8 and derivatives (tested with Rocky Linux 8)

The default gcc version isn't new enough to build Qt, so the first
step is to set up scl gcc-toolset-11 if it is not already active:

dnf install scl-utils
dnf install gcc-toolset-11

To run in an environment with this toolset active:
scl enable gcc-toolset-11 bash

Out of the box, we won't be able to to install all the devel libraries
necessary per https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux-requirements.html - we need to
enable some additional package sources:

dnf install epel-release # needed for xcb cursor package
dnf update
/usr/bin/crb enable      # for PowerTools, extra xcb packages
dnf update

dnf install libXrender-devel libX11-devel libXext-devel libXfixes-devel libXi-devel freetype-devel fontconfig-devel mesa-libGL-devel libxcb-devel xcb-util-cursor-devel xcb-util-devel xcb-util-image-devel xcb-util-keysyms-devel xcb-util-renderutil-devel xcb-util-wm-devel libxkbcommon-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel
