A bunch of the patches are still adding FindZLIB.cmake - fix.

Make sure for all the Find*.cmake files we're adding we reference
the copy in the toplevel bext/CMake directory unless there's a reason
not to - shouldn't be making per-proejct addfiles/ copies of those
since we'd just have to update each one.

Right now, I don't think we're really handling switching config options
properly.  If we enable/disable individual components, dependencies using
those components need to be reset - their old compiles will no longer be
valid if one of their dependencies changes.  We need to:

1.  clear the output directories, so the contents reflect the new
    settings rather than keeping potentially outdated files

2.  remove old build directory contents for those projects that have
    had a dependency change status, so their compiles end up detecting
    and linking to the correct versions.  We can't depend on third
    party build systems to reset everything correctly, so we need to
    start clean.
